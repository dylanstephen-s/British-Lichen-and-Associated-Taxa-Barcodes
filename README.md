# British-Lichen-and-Associated-Taxa-Barcodes

This reference database provides barcodes for the mtSSU, ITS, 18S and 28S for British Lichens and Associated Taxa (Lichenicolous, non-lichenized taxa, and chemical races). This data is compiled from multiple reference databases (UNITE, GenBank, BOLD, GlobalFungi, and Martin7) in CSV format to be used directly in R or converted to FASTA files for command line scripting. Data was geographically limited to only include specimens collected from within Europe. The associated paper is located at the following link.
